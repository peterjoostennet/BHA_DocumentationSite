# Project update week 2

We did a brainstorm about the project we wanted to do.
I want to do genetic engineering with CRISPR/cas9.

Unfortunatly, it is not allowed in the Waag. <https://kiempunt-limburg.nl/nieuws/mogelijk-toch-experimenten-met-crispr-cas-in-nederland>

Other ideas:
* Restriction enzymes
* Bio informatics
