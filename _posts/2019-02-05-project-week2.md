# Project update week 2

We did a brainstorm about the project we wanted to do.
I want to do genetic engineering with CRISPR/cas9.

Unfortunatly, it is not allowed in the Waag. 
That is due to European regulations: <https://www.nemokennislink.nl/publicaties/europa-legt-crispr-cas-aan-banden/>

Other ideas:
* Restriction enzymes 
* Bio informatics
* Playing with The Odin kit <http://www.the-odin.com/diy-crispr-kit/>
* Testing the Minion <https://store.nanoporetech.com/starter-packs>

This is a test
