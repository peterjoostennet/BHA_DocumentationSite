title: Project update week 3
---

Last week (week 2) we This week started growing microbes under controlled conditions. We used Agar plates with the Janthinobacterium lividum (JL) culture. Unfortunately my petridish did no show any sign of the JL culture. Roland though it maybe be because the needle was to hot.

# My project

For now I decided I want to continue with the (wet) lab time.

My aim is to change organisms or genes:
1) buy a restriction enzyme kit: <http://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/product/restriction-digestion-analysis-lambda-dna-kit> 
2) try to mimick and hack this commercial kit
3) follow a CRISPR/cas9 experiment in Japan 

# My product

As product I am thinking of different things:
1) present the difference between restriction enzymes and CRISPR/cas9
2) see how I can continu the process at home

This will probably be in the form of a presentation, audio and/or video file.
