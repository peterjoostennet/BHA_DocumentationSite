Welcome to my logbook and documentation page ;)<br>

My inspiration comes from Joi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab. At the Solid Conference 2015 he gave a talk about the future of technology. His statement is 'Bio is the New Digital'. 

My goal of the Biohack Academy is to try and tinker with the future of biotechnology myself. <br>
These are my subprojects.

# The design of the future is ... hardware
For this part I made a simple but elegant webcam microscope. <br>
My reason is that my focus during the Biohack Academy is on labtime. Nevertheless, the (DIY) hardware is a vital part of the philosophy of both the Waag as well as the quote of Joi Ito. Therefore I decided I wanted to make at least one thing myself.<br>
From all of the gear in the Fablab I especially liked the 3D printer. I used the Prusa printer to make 3 units for the webcam microscope. 
<br>
This project is done.<br>
I even shared the pictures of the magnified cell (with the nucleas and membrames) at a talk. 

# The design of the future is ... biology (part 1)
This was kind of an extra project which I did not expect. But I found a clear instruction video on Youtube how to extract DNA from strawberries.<br>
Because of my fascination with DNA I decided I want to test this protocol for myself. And it worked!<br>
<br>
These are the steps:
* But a couple of strawberries in a sealable plastic bag
* Squash the strawberries till it is a mouse
* Pour the strawberries into a cup
* Add one spoon of detergent. The detergent will burst the lipid membrames of the cells and allow the DNA to be extracted
* Mix the strawberries and detergent for at least 30 seconds till little bells arise
* Carefully pour 95% percent alcohol into the glass, near the side of the glass. The alcohol will shed the DNA from the other cellmaterial. The white DNA strengs will float onto the surface.
<br>
I even demonstrated this procedure during a talk in which one part was about DNA and genetics. 

# The design of the future is ... biology (part 2)
The kit is delivered.<br>
Next steps
* Restriction digestion
* Gel electrophoresis
* Staining DNA

# The design of the future is ... biology
I ordered a part of a DNA strand at Eurofins Genomics. <br>
First I copied a sample out of Benchling. 
Besides the synthetic DNA, I also need primer. They advised me to use their regular standard primer <https://www.eurofinsgenomics.eu/en/dna-rna-oligonucleotides/optimised-application-oligos/q-pcr-primer/>
