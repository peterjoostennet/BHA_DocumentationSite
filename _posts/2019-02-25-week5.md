Welcome to my logbook and documentation page ;)<br>

# Endproduct

My inspiration comes from Joi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab. At the Solid Conference 2015 he gave a talk about the future of technology. His statement is 'Bio is the New Digital'. 
See his talk at Youtube: <https://youtu.be/pnHD8gvccpI>

My goal of the Biohack Academy is to try and tinker with the future of biotechnology myself.
What I did and what I learned I want to document in the following way:
* (Dutch) update on my blog <https://peterjoosten.net/biotechnologie>
* (English) the infographic <https://www.nextnature.net/2015/08/bio-new-digital/>
* (Genetics) encrypt the infographic into synthetic DNA

# Project 1 Restriction enzymes

I want to do genetic engineering. Not GMO, but only the cutting into DNA.

Update (next steps)
* I ordered the Restriction Enzymes kit
* When it is being delivered, I want to try and experiment with it.

# Project 2 Synthetic DNA

I am fascinated by the possibilities of synthetic biology. 

Update (next steps)
* Wait for the Infographic to finish
* Translate the picture (of the Infographic) into DNA code
* Ask Hansjorg Petschko for the algoritm 

# Project 3 DIY microscope

I like the Prusa 3D printer which is in the Fablab at the Waag in Amsterdam. So I thought I make a simple webcam microscope with 3D printing.

Update
* Printing the microscope (doing it right now!)
* Buy the other parts and make the microscope
