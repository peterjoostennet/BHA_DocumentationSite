Introduction

# Project 1 Restriction enzymes

Yeah! I orderded the Biorad kit <http://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/product/restriction-digestion-analysis-lambda-dna-kit>.

Plan
* See how the Restriction Digestion and Analysis of Lambda DNA Kit works
* Do the experiment in the Waag in Amsterdam
* See if I can do the experiment in my kitchen at home

The lambda phage is a bacterial virus that infects E.coli <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage>. 
The bacterial virus has approximately 48,000 base pairs.

How does the kit work? 
* Each restriction enzyme used in this kit cuts the lambda DNA several times, generating distinct sets of DNA restriction fragments of different sizes.
* The three different sets of DNA fragments that result from the enzymatic digestion are separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized.
* Compare the banding patterns from each sample to each other and to a DNA size standard. 
* Use the electrophorsis results to construct standard curves and determine the precise DNA fragment sizes generated by the different restriction enzymes.

**Next steps**

These are the next steps:
* Ask Roland if the kit is allowed in the Waag (probably it is, because I am not making an GMO)
* Fill in the form and order the kit

# Project 2 Synthetic DNA

I am fascinated by the possibilities of synthetic biology. 
* Write a sentence in the DNA studio and convert it to DNA code <https://www.synbio-tech.com/dna-studio/>
* Order the sequence as synthetic DNA <https://www.eurofinsgenomics.eu/en/gene-synthesis-molecular-biology/gene-synthesis/>

**Next steps**

These are the next steps:
* Ask Roland if I can order the synthetic DNA
* Discuss what I can do with the synthetic DNA (some ideas: write a poem in it and see it under a microscope)

# Project 3 DIY microscope

Making labproducts
* I like the Prusa 3D printer which is in the Fablab at the Waag in Amsterdam. So I thought I make a simple webcam microscope <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2270505>

**Next steps**

These are the next steps:
* Download the Cura files
* Ask Conor to help me with the setup

# Presentation

For the presentation I am thinking of different things:
* present the difference between restriction enzymes and CRISPR/cas9
* see how I can continu the process at home

This will probably be in the form of a presentation, audio and/or video file.
