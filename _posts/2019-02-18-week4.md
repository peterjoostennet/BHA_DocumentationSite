title: Project update week 4

Welcome to my logbook and documentation page ;)
Currently, I am thinking of 3 projects
* 1 Restriction enzymes
* 2 Synthetic DNA
* 3 DIY webcam

# Project 1 Restriction enzymes

Yeah! I orderded the Biorad kit: <http://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/product/restriction-digestion-analysis-lambda-dna-kit> .

Plan
* See how the Restriction Digestion and Analysis of Lambda DNA Kit works
* Do the experiment in the Waag in Amsterdam
* See if I can do the experiment in my kitchen at home

The lambda phage is a bacterial virus that infects E.coli: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage>. 

The bacterial virus has approximately 48,000 base pairs.

How does the kit work? 
* Each restriction enzyme used in this kit cuts the lambda DNA several times, generating distinct sets of DNA restriction fragments of different sizes.
* The three different sets of DNA fragments that result from the enzymatic digestion are separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized.
* Compare the banding patterns from each sample to each other and to a DNA size standard. 
* Use the electrophorsis results to construct standard curves and determine the precise DNA fragment sizes generated by the different restriction enzymes.

*More information about restriction enzymes*

This is a very helpful video about restriction enzymes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2cKywEn6KY>

Notes
* Restriction enzymes (RE) are a protection mechanism of bacteria against virusses
* The RE needs to recognize a certain sequence
* For example, Ecor1 recognizes a palindromic sequence
* It cuts in non methylated sequences, because these are not from the bacteria itself
* The RE cuts DNA open and leaves so-called sticky ends
* Possible applications are making synthetic insulin by putting the insulin gene into the open part of the bacteria gene

This is a very helpful video about molecular biology <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYIZgS-L5Sc>

Notes
* TAQ polymorase discovered in Yellowstone park
* Quote: Genetic engineering is build upon this method (but is was before CRISPR/cas9)
* Analogy of ransom note: scissors are RE, glue are hydrogen bonds, liner is gel electroprosis, copier is PCR and human eye is DNA sequencing
* An example of a RE is Hind3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HindIII> which is also in the Bio-rad kit!
* Hind3 is different compared to Ecor1, because it cuts at a different place.
* What I do not understand, what is the role of the primer in TAQ polymorase? Probably to be used in PCR to copy and cut? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taq_polymerase>

**Next steps**

These are the next steps:
* Ask Roland if the kit is allowed in the Waag (probably it is, because I am not making an GMO)
* Fill in the form and order the kit

# Project 2 Synthetic DNA

I am fascinated by the possibilities of synthetic biology. 
* Write a sentence in the DNA studio and convert it to DNA code <https://www.synbio-tech.com/dna-studio/>
* Order the sequence as synthetic DNA <https://www.eurofinsgenomics.eu/en/gene-synthesis-molecular-biology/gene-synthesis/>

**Next steps**

These are the next steps:
* Ask Roland if I can order the synthetic DNA
* Discuss what I can do with the synthetic DNA (some ideas: write a poem in it and see it under a microscope)

# Project 3 DIY microscope

Making labproducts
* I like the Prusa 3D printer which is in the Fablab at the Waag in Amsterdam. So I thought I make a simple webcam microscope <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2270505>

**Next steps**

These are the next steps:
* Download the .stl files
* Download Cura program
* Buy webcam
* Ask Conor to help me with the setup

# Presentation

For the presentation I am thinking of different things:
* present the difference between restriction enzymes and CRISPR/cas9
* see how I can continu the process at home

This will probably be in the form of a presentation, audio and/or video file.
