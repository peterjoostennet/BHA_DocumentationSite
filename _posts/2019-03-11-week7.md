title: Project update week 7

Welcome to my logbook and documentation page ;)<br>

My inspiration comes from Joi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab. At the Solid Conference 2015 he gave a talk about the future of technology. His statement is 'Bio is the New Digital'. 

My goal of the Biohack Academy is to try and tinker with the future of biotechnology myself. <br>
These are my subprojects.

# DIY microscope
This project is done.<br>
This Friday I want to use the microscope during a presentation.

# Dirty DNA extraction
Based on a simple instruction on internet I seperated the DNA strands from a couple of strawberries. <br>
I used strawberries, a plastic sealed plastic bag, soap and alcohol (95%). 

# Restriction enzymes
The kit is delivered.<br>
Next steps
* Restriction digestion
* Gel electrophoresis
* Staining DNA

# Synthetic DNA
I ordered a part of a DNA strand at Eurofins Genomics. <br>
First I copied a sample out of Benchling. 
Besides the synthetic DNA, I also need primer. They advised me to use their regular standard primer <https://www.eurofinsgenomics.eu/en/dna-rna-oligonucleotides/optimised-application-oligos/q-pcr-primer/>
