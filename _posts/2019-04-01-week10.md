title: Project update week 9
---

Welcome to my logbook and documentation page ;)<br>

My inspiration comes from Joi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab. At the Solid Conference 2015 he gave a talk about the future of technology. His statement is 'Bio is the New Digital'. His quote on which my project it based is: _'The design of the future is hardware, it's software, it's biology and it's complex.. But you have to know math.'_

My goal of the Biohack Academy is to try and tinker with the future of biotechnology myself. <br>

# Final presentation

Take a look at my presentation for an update (and pictures): <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iQGf3zNRhKPUyp9L-tkgpL7eB5ZujxsHIc1U7SvHuCM/edit?usp=sharing>

The documentation of my project is in the week 9 blogpost <https://peterjoostennet.github.io/week9/> and week 8 blogpost <https://peterjoostennet.github.io/week8/>

# The design of the future is ... biology (part 2)

This is the result of the restriction enzymes project from last week: <https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1U2tj5D8ORotr2cZ_6X7LAENaTFeoE0Trqg2OdQcCXGM/edit?usp=sharing>

It is a nice representation of the amount of cutsites in the bacteriophage: <https://benchling.com/wpjoosten/f/Rq44S3V1-20190314-synthetic-dna/seq-FbDOARdi-20190314-kopie-lambda/edit>
There are 7 Hind3 restriction sites, so the digestion should result in 8 fragments. Six are large enough to be seen. EcoR1 should generate 6 fragments, while the Pst1 should give 29 lambda DNA fragments. They are migrated so closely together on the gel that they appear as one band.

# The design of the future is ... software

One project which is still open is the ordering of synthetic DNA.
<br>
The next steps:
* Calculate the primer and PCR mixes
* Multiply the DNA in the PCR
* Do a gel electrophoresis 
* Make the lay-out for the exhibition :)
