Introduction

# Project 1 Restriction enzymes

Yeah! I orderded the Biorad kit <http://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/product/restriction-digestion-analysis-lambda-dna-kit>.
I did sent it to the Waag in Amsterdam, so hopefully it arrives well over there.

Next steps
* See how the Restriction Digestion and Analysis of Lambda DNA Kit works
* Do the experiment in the Waag in Amsterdam
* See if I can do the experiment in my kitchen at home

# Project 2 Synthetic DNA

I am fascinated by the possibilities of synthetic biology. 
* Write a sentence in the DNA studio and convert it to DNA code <https://www.synbio-tech.com/dna-studio/>
* Order the sequence as synthetic DNA <https://www.eurofinsgenomics.eu/en/gene-synthesis-molecular-biology/gene-synthesis/>

# Project 3 DIY microscope

Making labproducts
* I like the Prusa 3D printer which is in the Fablab at the Waag in Amsterdam. So I thought I make a simple webcam microscope <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2270505>

# Presentation

For the presentation I am thinking of different things:
* present the difference between restriction enzymes and CRISPR/cas9
* see how I can continu the process at home

This will probably be in the form of a presentation, audio and/or video file.
