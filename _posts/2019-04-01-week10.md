title: Project update week 9
---

Welcome to my logbook and documentation page ;)<br>

My inspiration comes from Joi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab. At the Solid Conference 2015 he gave a talk about the future of technology. His statement is 'Bio is the New Digital'. His quote on which my project it based is: _'The design of the future is hardware, it's software, it's biology and it's complex.. But you have to know math.'_

My goal of the Biohack Academy is to try and tinker with the future of biotechnology myself. <br>
